Decision trees are a technique used in machine learning for classification. Although based on the same principles, the technique does not follow the same procedures that we have seen in class to solve decision trees (classification is a completely different application field!). Your assigment is to write a Jupyter Notebook of 2-4 pages long (if printed in PDF format) containing a research paper with the following mandatory sections: 

- Introduction

Describe the theory and the technique. 

- Implementation

Describe how to implement decision tree classification in Python

- Conclusion

Write down the main conclusions of your research, describing real life applications 

- Bibliography

Enumerate the references used in your work. 



Attached to this task, you can find a template Notebook you can use to comply with your assignment.
